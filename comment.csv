Ideas, religious and otherwise, should be subject to reason, logic, and in the way that Rushdie means it, disrespect. 

Just because an idea is religious does not give is a pass concerning reason. Faith and reason have always gone together, as friends, in classical Christianity. 

Not scientific materialism, mind you. But reason."," “You’ve gotta respect everyone’s beliefs."" No, you don’t. That’s what gets us in trouble. 

Look, you have to **acknowledge** everyone’s beliefs, and then you have to reserve the right to go: ""That is fucking stupid. Are you kidding me?"" 

I acknowledge that you believe that, that’s great, but I’m not going to respect it. I have an uncle that believes he saw Sasquatch. We do not believe him, nor do we respect him!

There really is no need to get upset about it since big floaty guy will inevitably deal with me soon enough right?","Religion is essentially about control and exploitation of the fear of death and meaninglessness.

Fear is the tool of control.","I see the general point Rushdie is making here, but he has used some problematic phrases

Religion does not ""deserve"" fearless disrespect simply because it is religion, nor are we obligated to invoke hostility against religion

Now should religion be subject to criticism and analysis? Of course --there is nothing to fear from this.

But men like Rushdie must remember that I will also criticize his ideology and subject it to the same disrespect he shows my religion. The secular world cannot claim an exemption","Even more badass when you realize the Ayatollah Khomeini issued a fatwā against him.","Exactly!","100% agree with this.

I respect no religion. Not because of hate or ""I can't do what I want"" or any of that kind of crap that religious people want to lay on others because they disagree.

I intellectually violently disagree just because of logic and rationality. I think that once you can get someone to believe irrational shit, like you can bring a dead person back to life (the daughter of Jairus.[Mk 5:21-43], The Young Man from Nain.[Lk 7:11-17],  the raising of Lazarus.[Jn 11:1-44]), walking on water, feeding multitudes from a small basket of food), healing a man blind from birth, pasting an ear back on someone's head....

Then, *then*, they want to have 10 commandments in courtrooms (which no court follows anyways, except for theft, perjury, and murder - no court follows the rest of them, give me a break), trying to teach creationism in the *science* class as an actual scientific theory (makes me throw up in my mouth every time I think of it). 

So, once you can get someone to think that one clearly irrational thing is possible (all the ""miracles""), then you can make them believe *anything*. That's why you get everyone saying their god makes AIDS to punish homosexuals, for one example. But *conveniently*, those same christians many who support Donald Trump, won't say that the locusts plaguing Africa and India, the pandemics, are punishment to *them* because *they* elected Donald Trump. They are great at pointing the finger at others.

And they oppress others, yet say that *they* are the oppressed, despite 99.999% of the officeholders in the USA are christians, jews, or muslims. Not too many atheists.

Yes, religion deserves nothing but disrespect. There is nothing redeeming about it, and to the extent that something good *may* happen, it would happen without religion. Look at all the christians in the USA right now, this very minute, who  are ready to commit violence on each other. The christian left and the christian right are ready to go into total violence mode come election day. One *might* give the lame excuse that it is peoples' free will, but if fighting engulfs the USA, to what good is a religion? How does it help if it is so weak that it cannot keep people from fighting. I think that religion should be abandoned, and in its place one should create and join organizations that, as their *first* priority, place rationality and knowledge of the natural world as the top importance. As we know, being religious places top priority to *believing* that people walk on water or come to life after they die. Psychotic.","Live and let live youll be much happier in life.
